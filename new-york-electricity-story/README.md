## Issues
The full interactive project is now only available for PC.
For Mobile and Tablet, static plots are provided.

Due to the reason that the original design doesn't go well with narrow screens, full features are not 
compatible with mobiles and tablets. The purpose is to give every user a satisfied visualization experience.
